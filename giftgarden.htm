          <p>This apartment is his world. Something grows within the walls and within his being. Her world lies beyond these walls. Beyond him. Consumed by a malignant jealousy, he watches as she fades away. Trying to hold on to her. To reach her. To restore her. He must struggle against the garden and its gifts. The buried remnants of his failure. The fruit of a twisted tree. Find his way back to her.</p>
