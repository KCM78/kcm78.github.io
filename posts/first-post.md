## Welcome to the new kennymooney.com
After a while with no website, I've put together a new blog/website. I've written this from the ground up in NextJS, rather than using another WordPress installation. As great as WordPress is, I've found the last few versions getting increasingly bloated and clunky, and frankly a pain to use. Writing this myself has been a fun learning process. I'm already pretty familiar with React itself, so using the Next framework has been a great little project. I also made use of TailwindCSS for the styling - I've never used a CSS library before, so that was new. It did make me realise just how out of practice I am with CSS though.

The other cool thing about writing this myself is I've been able to dispense with a database on the backend completely. All the blog posts are done in Markdown and then parsed to HTML. As a result the site is hosted entirely on my own github.
