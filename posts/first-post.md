## Welcome to the new kennymooney.com
So this is my new website. I've had a few over the last few years, and often I just let them die off because my own self-doubt can just get the better of me and that leads to online self-destruction.

I'm trying though. This is a new site, a new start at things. For those interested in the technical aspects (this is my job, after all), this is built from the ground up in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. It is hosted on my github, so no irritating web hosting account. Also no WordPress installation to get in the way.

Yes, it is a bit bare around here, but this is an ongoing work in progress, and the blog will fill up as I post more often. I'd like to do something with it this time, so will see what happens there.
