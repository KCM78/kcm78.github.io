    "content": "In an enormous, abandoned tower, a man is on a quest to meet his god. As he climbs the floors of empty apartments, he will face his fears, his guilt, his sins. In the depths of an ancient mine, a woman crawls through the darkness. Far underground she rambles to herself, recounting the stories of her life, her myths, her fables of old. In the vast and boundless deep, memories blur.",

    "title": "Desk Clerk",
    "content": "Pristina, the photocopy girl, wages war on reality, tearing a hole through space and time. People fall through apartments, hospitals, cities, black holes, and each other. In an unapologetically nihilistic attack upon all the organs of social control, DESK CLERK weaves a fragmentary prose-poem exploring alienation, guilt, and the ways in which failure condemns and empowers.",

    "title": "The Gift Garden",
    "content": "This apartment is his world. Something grows within the walls and within his being. Her world lies beyond these walls. Beyond him. Consumed by a malignant jealousy, he watches as she fades away. Trying to hold on to her. To reach her. To restore her. He must struggle against the garden and its gifts. The buried remnants of his failure. The fruit of a twisted tree. Find his way back to her.",
