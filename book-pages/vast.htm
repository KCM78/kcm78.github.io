          In an enormous, abandoned tower, a man is on a quest to meet his god. As he climbs the floors of empty
          apartments, he will face his fears, his guilt, his sins. In the depths of an ancient mine, a woman crawls
          through the darkness. Far underground she rambles to herself, recounting the stories of her life, her myths,
          her
          fables of old. In the vast and boundless deep, memories blur.
