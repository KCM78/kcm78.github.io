          Pristina, the photocopy girl, wages war on reality, tearing a hole through space and time. People fall through
          apartments, hospitals, cities, black holes, and each other. In an unapologetically nihilistic attack upon all
          the organs of social control, DESK CLERK weaves a fragmentary prose-poem exploring alienation, guilt, and the
          ways in which failure condemns and empowers.
